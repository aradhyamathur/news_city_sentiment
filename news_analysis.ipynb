      "The Delhi government’s excise department has decided to counsel and take written undertakings from customers in pubs and restro-bars who are caught sharing or ordering liquor for friends/relatives under 25 years in age.\n",
      "Sources in the department said teams would conduct surprise checks at restro-bars across the city. “People often come in to lounge bars, order drinks and pass it on to their underage friends or relatives. We have decided to go have a chat with anyone doing so and ask them to give a written undertaking that they won’t offer liquor to an underage person again,” an official said.\n",
      "At present, the Delhi’s excise law lays down strict action against a liquor licensee (restaurant/bar owner/seller) for supplying alcohol to underage people.  But, it does not prescribe any action for a third party or a person caught violating the rule.\n",
      "If a licensee is caught serving liquor to underage people, police and excise department can either fine them or register an FIR. The excise department can also suspend or cancel the licence of the establishment.\n",
      "“The undertaking will just be a gentle way of spreading awareness about Delhi’s legal age of drinking. Nobody would like to spoil their evening by running into police and excise inspectors at bars. This will also act as a deterrent,” the official added.\n",
      "Action against restro-bars\n",
      "The department has deputed five teams from the enforcement wing and 60 personnel from the excise intelligence bureau (EIB) in the drive against underage drinking. \n",
      "In recent raids at restrobars, pubs and lounges, FIRs were lodged against seven outlets in areas such as Punjabi Bagh, Pitampura and Rajouri Garden for serving liquor to underage people.\n",
      "“Among the seven cases, we suspended licences of five outlets,” said Praveen Mishra, deputy commissioner (excise).\n",
      "CCTV footage\n",
      "Excise officials have asked bars to provide CCTV footage. “We ask for CCTV recordings from bars based on tip-offs given to us by the EIB and other sources. If we find liquor being offered to any visibly underage person, action will be taken against the restaurant owner,” Mishra added.\n",
      "The officials, however, said catching underage drinking offenders is a tricky task. “We go by appearance and also by ID proof, which are often deceptive. Restaurant owners say that if they have to ask every person for their IDs, it would drive away customers,” an official said..\n",

      "A DTC bus driver, accused of crushing a man under its wheels over 11 years ago, has been acquitted by a Delhi court which held the passenger responsible for his fate as he tried to deboard the moving bus in haste.\n",
      "The court absolved the accused of the charge of causing death by negligence saying it was the “over-hasty act” of the passenger who tried to alight from the bus even before it reached the stop.\n",
      "“When the bus stop was around only 50 yards from the point of accident, it was the duty of the passenger that he should have waited till the arrival of bus stand.\n",
      "“De­boarding from a moving bus and that too prior to the arrival of bus stand is the over hasty act of the passenger for which the bus driver cannot be held responsible,” Metropolitan Magistrate Kapil Kumar said.\n",
      "The court said there were contradictions in the prosecution story as on one hand the investigating officer claimed to have recorded the statement of the eye witness on the spot within 15 minutes of the incident, on the other hand, he claimed to have reached the spot an hour later.\n",
      "The court also observed that the testimony of the alleged eye witness, who was a police official on patrol duty, could not be relied upon as he did not inform the police station immediately after the incident.\n",
      "“Prosecution witness 1 (eye witness) was not an ordinary layman, rather he is a police official. The reasonable conduct of a police official must have been to inform the police station immediately rather than waiting for some other person to give the information,” it said.\n",
      "The court accepted the contention of the accused driver that the passenger was standing at the rear door of the bus and when he slowed down the bus near Minto Road here, the man tried to deboard the bus and received injuries.\n",

      "When Sunil Kumar got into Shahid Amir Chand Sarvodya Vidyalaya in 1986, his admission was a privilege made possible by his father's position as a teacher at the school. \n",
      "Known locally in Civil Lines as Ludlow Castle Number 2, the government school was an elite bastion. Its students were the children of senior bureaucrats and prominent local businessmen. \n",
      "This July, when Kumar returned to Ludlow as an English teacher, he was struck by how much had changed. The formal white uniforms with grey and yellow striped ties had been replaced by more casual blue and white checked shirts; much of the playground had been fenced off for a practice stadium for the 2010 Commonwealth Games; the morning assembly no longer featured students playing a variety of musical instruments; and class sizes had grown from an average of around 40 to 85.\n",
      "The student body had changed as well, and now came from marginalised families: the children of plumbers and carpenters, shopkeepers and salesmen.\n",
      " \"It now felt like a government school,\" said Kumar, unthinkingly reflecting the bias that only working-class kids go to state schools. \"In my time, it was better than a private school.\"\n",
      "Sunil Kumar, who returned to the Ludlow Castle school as a teacher, was struck by how much it had changed in thirty years. \n",
      "Ludlow Castle is still better, according to its teachers and students, than many of Delhi's 2,682 private schools. Yet Kumar's own kids study in a private school near their family's home in east Delhi, and none of the students in Kumar's classes are the child of a Ludlow teacher.\n",
      "This is common among teachers, administrators, and officials charged with running the government school system. Padmini Singla, an IAS officer who has headed Delhi's department of education for two years, sends both her children to private school. \"Every parent tries to provide the best for their kids,\" she said. \"My parents did that for me and I am doing that for my kids.\"\n",
      "The change in the composition of the student body at Ludlow Castle is reflective of the country's public school system as a whole. Successive school-enrolment drives have more kids attending class than ever before, but the state-run school system has been abandoned by everyone who can afford an alternative.\n",
      "This exodus of the elite, experts say, is both a cause and a consequence of the unravelling of India's public schools. It also explains why their declining quality has attracted little outrage, despite a mounting body of anecdotal and statistical evidence highlighting the country's abysmal education standards. \n",
      "There are no reliable, long-term studies tracking the performance of India's government schools, but a study commissioned by the Delhi government last year found that 74% of class 6 students in government schools could not read a paragraph from their textbooks. Only 54% could read anything at all.\n",
      "The Delhi government has devoted a quarter of the state's annual budget to train teachers, expand buildings, improve classroom facilities, and make school curricula more relevant.  But the fact that Kumar, and almost all his fellow teachers, don't trust the system to educate their own children indicates the scale of the challenge that government schools face.\n",
      "Ludlow Castle is reflective of the country's public school system, where government schools have been abandoned by everyone who can afford an alternative.\n",
      "From its inception in 1970, Ludlow was intended to be a 'model school', a showcase establishment to be gradually emulated across the public school system. In Ludlow's case, this meant the school had a verdant playground for football and cricket; an accomplished swim team that practiced in their own 25-metre pool on campus; a reputation for an unbending adherence to academic excellence; and some of the city's most privileged children.\n",
      "Sunil Kumar's father, Ranbir Singh, said influential officers and politicians often sought to get the children of their constituents admitted in the school, but the principals were impervious to such pressure.\n",
      "\"Once the deputy director of education's son was creating mischief,\" said Singh, who taught at Ludlow in the 1980s. \"The principal called his father and said, 'Pay attention to your son, I don't want him to ruin my school's result.'\"\n",
      "Singh adopted a reverential tone as he recalled this act of bureaucratic bravado. \"Just imagine, a principal telling the deputy director of education, 'Pay attention to your son.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The school, and particularly the depth of his teachers' investment in his progress, left a lasting impression on Kumar. Though he's 41 years old, Kumar still has his grey and yellow school tie tucked away in a drawer at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I didn't know the answer to a question, my teachers would send me to my father,\" Kumar said. \"He would frown and say, 'Don't bring shame upon me, don't forget you are a teacher's son'.\"\n",
      "When Kumar graduated in 1994, his yearbook reflected the ambitions of a student body primed to take their place in the echelons of power. A photo essay shows pictures of a parliamentary debate in progress: serried ranks of kurta-clad boys and solemn girls, identified as the \"Treasury Benches\" in the caption, look on as a defiant \"Government\" takes on a feisty \"Opposition\".\n",
      "\"We looked down on children from private schools,\" said Kumar of his student days. \"We thought they were not smart enough get into a government school.\"\n",
      "Total enrolment in government schools across 20 major Indian states fell, as more and more people opted for private schools. \n",
      "The decade after Kumar graduated brought many changes to Delhi's government school system. Enrolment did rise in the 1990s, but the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan scheme in 2001 and the passage of the right to Education Act in 2009 led to a gigantic increase — almost 200 million children from 2001 to 2016.\n",
      "\"When many more poor and disadvantaged children started entering the government school system, the middle classes marched out,\" said Vimala Ramachandran, a former professor at the National University of Educational Planning and Administration who has written on the Indian school system for over 20 years.\n",
      "As schools lost support from the rich and powerful, they declined. The new crop of parents, from poor and marginalised communities, couldn't hold teachers and school administrators to account. \n",
      "\"Government officials and political leaders no longer had a stake in ensuring government schools ran well,\" said Ramachandran. \"Their children had left, so monitoring became weak.\" \n",
      "Through the 1990s and 2000s, successive pay commissions also substantially increased the salaries of government employees, enabling teachers to afford private school for their children. By 2014, government school teachers were earning seven times the per capita income, according to data compiled by Geeta Kingdon, a professor of education economics at University College London. Their salaries were only a fraction of those of bureaucrats.\n",
      " \"As people become more affluent over time, they seek a wealthier peer group for their children,\" said Kingdon, who has written extensively on education in India. \"Parents also believe in the importance of English, and believe that private schools teach English better. And finally, they believe that the quality of education is better in private schools.\"\n",
      "In a paper on private schooling published in March, Kingdon found that about 30% of the city's students now study in private schools. Across the country, the adoption of private schooling has been so brisk, according to her research, that total enrolment in government schools across 20 major Indian states actually fell by 13 million students from 2010-11 to 2015-16 while private-school enrolment increased by 17.5 million.\n",
      "Simran Pal moved to a government school from a private one, an exception to the trend. \n",
      "Simran Pal and some of her classmates at Ludlow Castle are an exception to the broader trend of students abandoning government schools for private schools. Simran joined the school last year, in Class 11, from a small private school in west Delhi.\n",
      "India's Right to Education Act of 2009 requires schools to accept children from their surrounding areas before enrolling children from further away up to Grade 8. This means children like Simran, who live in working class neighbourhoods on the outskirts of the city, must either attend crowded and poorly run government schools nearby or enrol in an affordable private school.\n",
      "The neighbourhood requirement is relaxed for senior classes, which means children can attend better government schools further away, if they can score high-enough marks to gain admission. So after her Class 10 board examinations, Simran and her father, Surendra Pal, began looking for a government school outside their neighbourhood.\n",
      "Simran wanted to study science and dreamed of joining the Indian civil services, an ambition that calls for expensive afterschool tuitions. A good government school, the family reasoned, would mean the money they saved on fees for private school could be spent on tuitions instead.\n",
      "Pal did a fortnight of research and zeroed-in on Ludlow Castle. The school was an hour away from their home, so the family shifted to a house on the Delhi Metro's red line so Simran could safely commute to school each day.\n",
      "\"Ludlow castle has better facilities than my earlier school,\" said Simran one afternoon in Ludlow's airy physics lab as her class experimented with a 'Wheatstone bridge', a circuit used to calculate electrical resistance. \"The classrooms and playground are bigger, and the labs here have better equipment.\"\n",
      "Simran's new classmates come from a mix of government and private schools across the city. Many have switched schools because their previous government schools do not offer science for Class 11 and 12; others enrolled because their private schools charge higher fees for senior classes that their parents cannot afford.\n",
      "Simran now goes for tuitions seven days a week: Maths every Monday, Wednesday and Friday; Physics, Chemistry and Biology on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays; and tests on Sundays.\n",
      "These tuitions are necessary at today's Ludlow. According to interviews with six students in class 12, some teachers assume that their pupils have already covered material with their tutors, so do little in class aside from assigning homework. These interviewees also said they were generally happy with the teaching at school.\n",
      "In January this year, Ludlow made an unexpected return to public consciousness when a replica of the school complex was part of the state's tableau at the Republic Day parade. Officials said this signalled the government's renewed commitment to education — this time for the many, rather than the few.\n",

      "In a press statement, Bharti Airtel said it has been a strong supporter of the event over the last decade but has received “a lot of feedback from our customers and citizens at large expressing concern on holding the marathon in view of the prevailing air pollution in the city.”\n",
      "“For the upcoming edition we have discussed the air quality issue with the organisers, Procam and they have assured us that they are taking several measures to minimise the impact of air pollution on the runners,” it said.\n",
      "Airtel said the marathon, which infuses the spirit of fitness and good health, is a voluntary event and runners should take into consideration the environmental factors, including pollution and their health, while participating.\n",
      "“Air pollution poses serious health risks and it is important that these concerns are addressed urgently and appropriately by the authorities for Airtel to continue association with the event next year and beyond,” the statement said.\n",
      "A team of professionals is being deployed by Procam before the race to sprinkle salt mixed with effluent treated water across the entire track to ensure that the dust pollution is negated. Also, no vehicles will be plying on the route of the marathon.\n",
      "The race was sponsored by Hutchison Essar for its first two years, and the company sponsored the event as Vodafone Essar in 2007 following a takeover. Airtel has held the sponsor role since 2008.\n",
      "Procam in a press statement on November 4 said demands for cancellation or postponement of this year’s race were “shortsighted and misplaced”.\n",
      "“The Airtel Delhi Half Marathon is inherently a panacea for the pollution issue plaguing Delhi. The race day keeps cars off the designated 21 km of the city, and salt mixed with effluent treated water that is used to wash the course, ensures that the dust pollution is negated making the race day far more conducive for running,” it said.\n",

      "Every day, a man in his early 50s visits Kathputli Colony to distribute rice and dal among its residents, who are living on pavements and under the Shadipur flyover ever since their houses were razed to the ground in a demolition drive by Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on October 30.\n",
      "Similarly, every morning, a group of women from another locality arrive with tea and toast for the homeless families, who have refused to shift to a nearby transit camp and are staying put at the location.\n",
      "Those who have offered help are people from the neighbourhood as well as authorities of Prayer Foundation Church (New Patel Nagar) and Bangla Sahib Gurdwara near Connaught Place.\n",
      "Sukhvinder Singh (52), popular among the residents as “Sardarji”, hires a cycle rickshaw and goes among the homeless with two containers filled with rice and dal. He is also the president of the New Patel Nagar resident welfare association.\n",
      "Singh was appalled at the dismal conditions of hundreds of residents of the colony living on roadsides. He decided to feed them after noticing the residents, especially children begging for food.\n",
      "“Since the demolition drive, the street in front of my house has been filled with several homeless families. I have been living in this area for last 40 years, but never saw so much chaos. It is a pitiable condition,” said Singh.\n",
      "So, last week, he hired a cook and bought 100 kilos of rice and 30 kilos of dal. In a few hours, lunch was prepared to feed over a hundred people. Then he went about distributing it.\n",
      "Encouraged by his efforts, Singh’s friends also joined him. The gurdwara authority approached him and began distributing food during dinner time among the homeless persons, Singh said.\n",
      "Similarly, the church in New Patel Nagar has turned into a temporary shelter for few residents, where they are provided food and water.\n",
      "From 8 am onwards, Rupa Massey (20), one of the church members, begins making tea in the kitchen of the church. She lives in Najafgarh but comes to the church everyday to prepare morning tea and lunch for the residents of Kathputli Colony. By 10 am, she finishes making several rounds of tea.\n",
      "The ground floor of the church has become a temporary shelter for the homeless. Massey and several others like her work in the church kitchen from morning till evening to feed these residents.\n",
      "“Morning tea is served in disposable glasses along with a toast. We give it to every resident of Kathputli Colony, who has been coming to the church ever since their houses were demolished. They have no means to feed themselves, so we have been preparing food for them daily. Those who come to the church never go back hungry,” said Massey.\n",
      "For lunch, the church members prepare several kilos of steamed rice, dal and hundreds of rotis. They also make huge quantities of potatoes and cauliflower vegetable curry.\n",
      "“The people of Kathputli Colony, whose homes were destroyed last week, have been spending most of their time in this church. We prepare food and provide them shelter at night. It’s an open floor for them. We help them in whatever way we can,” said Mark, the church’s pastor.\n",

      "The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has proposed setting up its own aviation security training on the lines an institution being run in the United States (US). \n",
      "The move, the force said, would help them keep pace with newer technology being adopted to improve security standards at India’s airports.\n",
      "The Transport Security Administration (TSA) of USA currently operates a facility — TSA System Integration Facility (TSIF) — where it tests new technologies and trains its personnel.\n",
      "According to CISF officials, research and analysis related to aviation security will be conducted and security personnel will be trained in latest technology at the proposed facility. \n",
      "The CISF, which provides security at 59 of the 98 operational airports in the country, including Delhi, has prepared a report, ‘Future Projection September 2017’, where it has listed the requirement for aviation security in the next five years and also proposed creation of the dedicated training centre. \n",
      "The report has been sent to the Union ministry of civil aviation and the ministry of home affairs for approval.\n",
      "“Over the next five years, the CISF must continue to develop new capabilities in order to meet the passenger demand for a seamless experience at airports. It is imperative that the force focuses on digital surveillance and new technologies. We have proposed a Centre for Excellence for Aviation Security Training (CETAS) where research, training and testing of new equipment can be undertaken,” CISF’s director general OP Singh said.\n",
      "The centre will have aviation security and screener certification courses for CISF personnel posted at airports. \n",
      "“Other agencies will be allowed to register for the security training courses and the CISF will provide them certificates. \n",
      "“Nowadays, baggage scanning machines are installed at many places, but personnel handling such machines are not adequately trained. The centre may also be used to train such staff. Employees of airlines and the airport operator will also be trained as they play an important role in aviation security,” said a CISF offical, who contributed to preparation of the report.\n",
      "The CISF already runs aviation security training institutes in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Arakkonam (Chennai) and Hyderabad, where it imparts basic aviation security training, including screener certification courses (except at Arakkonam).\n",
      "But  there is an acute shortage of certified screeners at airports. The personnel monitoring the screen of baggage X-Ray machines need to be certified from any of the above CISF-run centres.\n",
      "“The centre may be utilized for conducting research and analysis of all past cases related to aviation security, like hijacking, sabotage, unlawful interference towards civil aviation, that have occurred worldwide and for preparation of case studies for taking suitable measures to mitigate such threats at Indian airports. The centre can be used to test new technologies and security gadgets, which can be introduced in aviation security,” reads the report, accessed by Hindustan Times.\n",

      "Sonwati knows a lot about the vagaries of a beggar’s life. After all, she has spent a considerable part of her life, ‘advising’ them as their ‘friend and guide’.\n",
      "“I have been like a mother to many beggars here; a lot of them are compelled to beg out of sheer poverty but there are others for whom begging is like a business,” says Sonwati, her eyes full of empathy.“But no beggar has come here for more than a year and I have nothing to do. This place is now like a haunted jungle.”\n",
      "Sonwati has been a sweeper for the past 33 years at Sewa Sadan, a sprawling complex with five homes for beggars in Lampur village on the city’s north-western fringes. The complex is operated by the Delhi government’s social welfare department. People found guilty of begging – an offence by law – by the court are sent here for one to three years.\n",
      "Sewa Sadan looks more like a salubrious college campus: it boasts of tree-lined paths strewn with leaves, vocational training rooms, an art room, a tennis court. The five beggars’ homes within the complex with their long, high-ceiling corridors, painted in blue-grey and pale-yellow, look like academic departments. The complex has 70 rooms with a capacity to house over 1,500 inmates, and also an impressive superintendent’s office.\n",
      "But what this grand complex for beggars does not have is beggars – not even one even though the city teems with beggars.\n",
      "On the wall, outside the superintendent’s office, is a board supposed to display ‘Residents strength of Sewa Sadan Complex at a Glance’. But the column that shows the day’s strength of each of the five houses is blank.\n",
      "All you can hear is the rustle of trees and the barking of dogs. Peep into the rooms of this otherwise salubrious place and you see darkness, dust and cobwebs draping everything inside.\n",
      "The superintendent, Krishan Kumar, we were told, rarely comes. We meet him at the social welfare department’s office in Gulabi Bagh, where he also serves as the district welfare officer. He is a curt, stout man with little patience for probing questions. Ask him about his job as the Lampur beggars’ home superintendent, and he tells you: “I am a senior superintendent, not superintendent. I go there just to clear salary-related work.”\n",
      "He would not divulge anything more but according to information provided by the social welfare department in response to an RTI application by Delhi-based RTI activist Rajhans Bansal in 2015, the government had spent more than Rs 26.95 crore since 2009-10 on the Sewa Sadan beggars’ facility – about Rs20 crore on salaries of employees and the rest on services, maintenance and operations.\n",
      "At present, only six employees are posted at the Sewa Sadan complex. Many have been transferred to other offices. “Though their sanctioned posts are at Sewa Sadan, they have been allocated work at different offices of the social welfare department,” says an official on the condition of anonymity since he is not authorised to speak to the media.\n",
      "In the last seven years, the number of inmates at the complex has been dwindling: it had 200 beggars in 2010; 75 in 2011; 80 in 2012; 40 in 2013; 60 in 2014. While three homes have been shut for years, one serves as FRRO’s (Foreigner Regional Registration Office) detention centre for restricted foreign nationals.\n",
      "Last year, the complex had one beggar – who, a staffer says, lived in ‘style’. “He had the entire 20 ft x 20 ft room to himself with a television, cooler, bed. He just did not want to go even after completion of his term as he was getting lodging, boarding and free food,” says a caretaker.\n",
      "Sonwati says the inmates may have been beggars outside but here some of them would behave like royals and demand food of their choice. \n",
      "“They would often ask for sweets and kheer. They were pretty nice to dogs and often offered them their leftovers,” she says, pointing to the seeming well-fed dogs menacingly roaming about in the premises. \n",
      "“I wish there were a few the beggars here, the place is so boring without them,” says Sonwati. “But it is tough dealing with beggars, a lot of them were drug addicts, and they would fight with each other. Beggars, for some reason, are very angry people. We have to ensure they do not run away,” says a staffer, talking about the difficulties of his job.\n",
      "Begging is an offence under the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959 (it was extended to Delhi in 1960). “We conduct raids and round up beggars, but they are rarely convicted by court these days. The court generally releases them when beggars are produced before it,” says a senior welfare department official.\n",
      "Rajendra Prasad Gautam, minister for social welfare, expressed his unawareness about the state of affairs at Sewa Sadan. “I will soon visit the Lampur facility and decide how it can be better used. We plan to open vocational training centres to prevent persons in livelihood crisis from begging. The idea is to enable them to earn their livelihood,” he said.\n",
      "It is 6 pm and darkness has decided on the Sewa Sadan complex. The guard, Karmveer, has just arrived for night duty. Is he not scared being the lone guard of such a large, deserted place? “Not really, I do not have to worry much, these dogs can take care of any trouble maker,” he says as he settles in his chair in the guard room.\n",

There are over 25 major office complexes in ITO, besides two Metro stations, seven major arterial roads and the Tilak Bridge Railway Station.\n",

      "A skywalk connects more than one road and is generally used at junctions with heavy traffic. It is longer than a foot overbridge (FoB) and has space for canopies, food shops and areas for pedestrians to sit.

      "“You don’t love Delhi in the wider discourse of pollution. You love it in the nuances and the stories that it is made up of,” says Aastha Chauhan, the festival director.\n",
      "From 85 walks in February last year to 170 in the third edition this year, the festival has come a long way in terms of its grandeur and the number of people associated with it. The idea was conceptualised in 2016 when the group of cultural enthusiasts joined hands to form Delhi I Love You –  a non-profit organisation, and the organiser of the festival. Before the first event, different people used to lead individual walks – some did it for free, others sometimes charged as much as ~2,500 per walk.\n",

Among the celebrities conducting the walks this year are activist Aruna Roy, historian William Dalrymple, musician Iqbal Ahmad Khan, urban planning expert Gautam Bhan, theatre director, MK Raina, chef Joe Baath, to name a few. \n",
      "The high point is that the walks cater to different tastes of different people. For example, someone who is interested in art can attend the ‘Ladies Only: Representation of Women in Modern India’ walk at the National Gallery of Modern Art by Flow India facilitators on November 5. Similarly, nature lovers can attend the ‘Jamali Kamali Tree Walk’ by Kavita Prakash, a graduate from Lady Shriram College, on November 12. Those interested in science can attend the ‘Science Fiction Walk’ at The National Science Centre on November 10. Foodie Anubhav Sapra will take meat lovers to old Delhi to open up a delicious world of kebabs, biryanis and kormas on November 5.\n",

      "Historian William Dalrymple, who will head the walk in Mehrauli, finds the initiative “terrific” as it provides an occasion for connecting people of Delhi with the city. \n",
      "“Delhi used to be a neglected city. Bengalis swear by Bengal, Mumbaikars swear by Mumbai but people in Delhi have no such connection,” says Dalrymple. “I think it is changing now. The city is extraordinary in itself and that is why I chose to live here. Exploring Delhi through walks is an enriching and rewarding experience.” \n",
      "His walk will explore the ruins of Dilkusha, the tomb house of the British agent, Sir Thomas Metcalfe, the summer palaces of the last three Mughal emperors, and Zafar Mahal completed by Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar just before the great uprising of 1857.\n",
      "The walking culture is not new to Delhi though. As historian Sohail Hashmi says, it was started by Prof Thomas George Percival Spear when he taught at St Stephen’s College (1924-48). “Spear used to take his students for a walk or on a bicycle from the college to Hauz Khas. That culture is catching up fast and we have seen an increase in the number of walks happening in the city,” says Hashmi, who will conduct five walks during the festival. \n",
      "Visually impaired entrepreneur Baldev Gulati will take blindfolded visitors to experience the Qutub on November 5. “The idea is to develop empathy among the masses about the challenges of the differently-abled in everyday urban space. It will be a walk with a difference, where you get into the shoes of those who feel and sense their surroundings differently” says Gulati. \n",

      "Many Many moons ago, after the fall of the Mughal dynasty in 1857, the poet Ghalib had this to say about his beloved city, Delhi: ‘The existence of Delhi is dependent on many spectacles: The Red Fort, Chandni Chowk, the daily crowds at Jama Masjid, the weekly jaunt around the Jamuna bridge, the annual fair at the Phool Waalo’n ki Sair – now that these five things are gone, Delhi isn’t Delhi.’\n",
      "Today, the Red Fort is a shell of its former self; Chandni Chowk is a traffic nightmare; the crowds that assembled on the steps of Jama Masjid to watch dastangoi performances, cockfights and enjoy conversations, are now composed of tourists or the faithful who go to offer prayers; and the Jamuna has receded far away.\n",
      "But the Phool Waalo’n ki Sair still continues, though in a restricted form.\n",
      "It was a week-long fair in which the emperor, his queens, the royal prince, princesses, nobles and inhabitants of Shahjahanabad went to Mehrauli every year. Much fun would be had by all: there were shopping stalls, diving competitions in the jharna, and swings in the mango orchards. Oil was heated in huge woks and piping hot sweets and savouries would be served; malhar or monsoon songs would be sung and dancing girls would show their moves. \n",
      "The entire area from the Yogmaya temple till the Bagh e Nazeer [now Ashoka Mission] would be lit up, full of vendors selling jewellery, food or other artifacts. \n",
      "Phool Waalo’n ki Sair has an interesting history: The Mughal emperor, Akbar Shah II (1808 -1837) had wanted to nominate his younger and favourite son Mirza Jahangir as his heir, instead of the eldest son [who later succeeded him as Bahadur Shah Zafar], a move that didn’t meet with the British Resident, Sir Archibald Seton’s approval. Mirza Jahangir, a hotheaded youth, mocked the Resident and later shot at him from one of the buildings in the Red Fort. Though Sir Archibald escaped the bullet, a guard got killed. Mirza Jahangir was exiled to Allahabad Fort. This caused great consternation and grief to his parents, particularly his mother, Mumtaz Mahal Begum.\n",
      "She made a vow that if he came back safely she would offer a chadar at the dargah of Delhi’s great Sufi saint Hazrat Qutubuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki in Mehrauli. When Mirza Jahangir was finally released, his mother fulfilled her vow with great pomp and ceremony. When the floral canopy and chadar for the shrine were being made, the flower sellers also made a floral pankha [fan shaped banner on a pole] and offered it on the shrine. According to her vow she walked barefoot, even as flower sellers spread flowers in her path to act as a cushion.\n",
      "The emperor and the queen shifted to Mehrauli for the Sair and the emperor also sent a floral offering to the nearby, ancient temple of Yogmaya Devi, Lord Krishna’s sister. Every year the emperor ensured he and his courtiers went to both the dargah and the temple. If he couldn’t go to the temple for some reason, he wouldn’t go to the dargah either. \n",
      "After the fall of the Mughal empire in 1857, Phool Waalo’n ki Sair was stopped. Later, it was continued by the British Commissioner of Delhi. In 1942, during the Quit India movement, the British government put a stop to the Sair to prevent popular participation and mass gatherings. Nehru asked Yogeshwar Dayal, a businessman of Delhi, to revive the festival. In 1962, it was registered under the Societies Registration Act and Nehru attended it in 1962 as a symbol of secular, modern India. It is a unique festival that truly symbolises India’s syncretic culture. The Sair e Gul Faroshan or Phool Waalo’n ki Sair which was traditionally held in the month of Bhado’n [August/September], is now held after the monsoon.\n",
      "Though the Mughal empire is no more, the tradition continues with the head of state being represented. Every year the President and Lt Governor of Delhi send a pankha which is carried in a procession from the Town Hall in Chandni Chowk to Mehrauli. On the first day, which is Thursday, a joyous procession goes to Qutubuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki’s dargah and offers floral chadars. Here it is the Hindu brethren who are supposed to take the lead. \n",
      "On Friday, the procession goes to Yogmaya Temple and offers the floral chadar, this time with the Muslim brethren taking the lead.On Saturday (today), there is a cultural function at Jahaz Mahal, a building from the Lodi period which may have been built for use of pilgrims to the dargah. Cultural troupes representing the states of India come in a procession holding pankhas and perform on stage. This year, there is a qawwali performance by Rais Anees Saabri and Yusuf Malik.\n",

      "Inside a courtroom last month, the Delhi government’s top bureaucrat’s counsel quoted him about how a tussle between the Chief Minister and the Lieutenant Government had left him in a difficult situation. While, the high court in this case was hearing Kutty’s plea against appearing before the  Assembly’s question and reference committee, his statement resonated with the bureaucracy that’s working for the national Capital.\n",
      "In a span of over two-and-a-half years, these Delhi government officials have faced suspensions, salary cuts, raids, CBI probes and even FIRs – making them the worst victims of the ongoing tussle between the two power centres in the city administration.\n",
      "Bureaucrats Hindustan Times spoke to, including ex-Delhi government officials, said the problem was a lack of clarity as to whose direction needs to be followed. “More than the government or the L-G, it is us, the bureaucrats, who are looking up to the case in the Supreme Court. At present, if we tow the line of action suggested by the minster, then the L-G objects. If we listen to the L-G, the ministers call us agents of the Centre,” said a government official, on condition of anonymity.\n",
      "Environment of suspicion is demoralizing \n",
      "The environment of suspicion at work is such that some officials sought transfers, a few others went on long leaves and the rest continued to work, but “without getting noticed.”\n",
      "“FIRs have been lodged against 30 officials and this is above the other probes in progress. In such a situation, it’s better to keep a low key. That is also one of the reasons why not even 50% of the government’s planned budget has been used till now,” another bureaucrat  said.\n",
      "The first public and biggest showdown between the bureaucrats and AAP government took place on December 31 when over 200 government officials went on en mass leave as two DANICS officials were suspended by health minister Satyendar Jain. Their suspension orders were later declared ‘non est and null’ by the Centre.\n",

      "“There is the Central Vigilance Commission, the CBI, ACB, Economic Offence Wing and the CAG here. The CBI cannot interfere in cases related to other Union Territories like Goa, Arunachal Pradesh or Mizoram.

I am very pained with whatever happened,” he said. \n",

      "Asked what new measures the city police are talking to get the expected response from public, Delhi Police chief spokesperson Dependra Pathak said, “Our technical team is trying to rectify the glitches the application has. We will soon come up with an improved and advanced version of the app for seamless functioning. We will promote it by interacting with communities at large besides using advertisements.” \n",

      "Nearly three children are raped everyday in the national capital according to the latest data of National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). HT spoke to a cross section of policemen, child rights activists and juvenile justice lawyers who identified some of the causes — such as mindset and consumption of pornography — which leave children vulnerable to such crimes.\n",
      "Bharati Ali, from HAQ Centre for Child Rights, said the root cause of high juvenile rape instances is the mindset of the people. She said more efforts need to be put into reforming people and changing their mindset.\n",
      "Juvenile Justice lawyer Anant Kumar Asthana, who has dealt with many such cases in the past, said that what separates Delhi from less urbanised or rural areas is a huge migrant population with no community participation. This, he said, takes away the secondary safety net that a child has in villages or even small towns.\n",
      "On recent rape trends, both said that consumption of pornography by offenders is also a major factor. \n",
      "Citing the example of an 18-year-old offender, Asthana explained how the offender regretted his actions but said pornography had left him with an urge he was unable to control.\n",
      "“It is not just about nuclear families. Many victims are from families where both parents go out to leaving them under the care and protection of neighbours, who usually are not as vigilant as one’s own parents would be. This gives an opportunity to those on the prowl to assault children,” said Asthana.\n",
      "“Also, these numbers may just be a fraction of the overall numbers as reporting rapes is still a taboo. That is again an area where work is needed to educate people to come and report cases even more so that they themselves desist,” she said.\n",
      "Wednesday’s incident where an 18-month-old was abducted and sexually assaulted by her 33-year-old neighbour in Aman Vihar serves as a gruesome reminder of the extent of the problem. Stakeholders said that despite efforts of government agencies, factors aiding such crimes — from poor conviction rates to lack of awareness and community support – continue to thrive as ever.\n",
      "According to latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data available, 927 children were raped in the national capital in 2015, which boils down to 2.5 rapes per day.\n",
      "Poor deterrence was also highlighted as a factor by experts. DCW chairsperson Swati Maliwal said she has been long requesting the Centre to constitute the high-level committee, which meets twice a month to work on issues of women safety but those were unheard. The commission in the past has also blamed the police for shoddy investigations and the numbers anyway show the low conviction rate.\n",
      "Last year, the Delhi High Court had also emphasised on the need of more special courts and special prosecutors for such cases as the lack was leading to delayed trials.\n",
      "Among other things, Asthana advocated that self defence training and community participation in ensuring proper care were also important to keep a check on such crimes.\n",

      "Buoyed by the positive response to its project to track cab rides via a quick response (QR) code at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi Police has decided to replicate it at 10 Metro stations by December-end.\n",
      "At the Delhi airport, cabs are provided with a QR code, which passengers can scan using Delhi Police’s Himmat mobile phone application to inform the cops about their journey. \n",
      "Along similar lines, commuters taking an auto-rickshaw to cover the last-mile distance after a Metro ride will soon be able to get the police to track their journey. The code will enable them to relay the information about the auto drivers and their real-time location to the police.\n",
      "Read: Delhi Police can now track your cab ride via QR code, make calls to check on you\n",
      "The tracking system will run on the Himmat app. Commuters without smartphones can send a text message to the police. The numbers will then be displayed in the autorickshaw.\n",
      "The stations selected for the pilot project are Raja Garden, Nehru Place, Malviya Nagar, Hauz Khas, Vishwavidyalaya, Indraprastha, Kashmere Gate, Qutub Minar, Netaji Subhash Place and Shastri Park. \n",
      "The police have begun the extensive exercise of collecting data of drivers around these 10 stations since one auto is operated by many people.\n",
      "The auto drivers, who normally drive around the metro stations, will have to display the QR code provided by the police at the back of the driver’s seat. \n",
      "“All the passenger has to do is scan the QR code after boarding the auto. The details will reach the control room and the GPS will start tracking the auto. During the ride, if the passenger feels something’s wrong, he/she can press the SOS button and the nearest police control room will be pressed into action,” said Sanjay Bhatia, deputy commissioner of police at Delhi Airport. \n",
      "“We will send two to three text messages to the passenger to know if they are safe. If possible, we may even get our personnel to call the passenger at the end of the journey,” said Sanjay Bhatia, deputy commissioner of police at the Delhi Airport.\n",
      "The trial at the Delhi’s airport began on October 6 with police placing QR codes in 10 black and yellow taxis. Besides the code, a card pasted behind the driver’s seat carries his photograph, his address, phone number, registration and details of the owner.\n",
      "Women who used the service were asked to rate the service between excellent and poor. “Ninety four per cent rated it between excellent and good. We are taking suggestions from those who did not like the service. The form had specific questions on the quality of the service. Happy with the response at the airport, especially from women, we will implement it at 10 metro stations to start with,” Bhatia said.\n",
      "The police asked the passengers a series of questions: “Are the details of driver/ owner adequate? Could you download the photograph of driver? Was the SMS service working properly? Should this service be extended to the auto and taxis of Delhi? Do you have Himmat app on your phone?”\n",
      "Fifty per cent said they had the Himmat app and all of them wanted the service to be extended to the Metro stations. .\n",

      "With winter approaching, shallow fog and mist are expected to engulf Delhi almost every morning over the next one week at least, the regional meteorological department has forecast.\n",
      "“We are expecting some shallow fog on Saturday and Sunday. For rest of the days, there could be some mist in the morning,” said Kuldeep Srivasatava, scientist with the regional weather forecasting centre in New Delhi. \n",
      "The only difference between fog and mist is that during fog the visibility is reduced to less than one kilometre and during mist it is more than one kilometre.Fog and mist are formed when water vapour in the air condenses. During condensation, molecules of water vapour combine to make tiny liquid water droplets that hang in the air.\n",
      "This means Delhiites would have to start early as there could be traffic snarls due to low visibility. \n",
      "Data available with the IMD says that on an average Delhi gets around 50 days of fog every year. While in November, the city gets around seven such days the number goes up in December and January. In January, Delhi gets around 17 days of fog. \n",
      "“Several factors such as a drop in the night temperature, high moisture content in the air and low wind speed are helping in the formation of fog and mist almost every morning,” he said. \n",
      "The night temperature has dropped from around 22 degrees Celsius on October 11 to around 17 degrees Celsius on Thursday. The wind speed is hovering around 1.5 metres per second, way below the required speed of 5 metres per second to disperse the water droplets and pollutants suspended in the air. The moisture content is also building up because of easterly winds.\n",
      "But low wind speed and high moisture content in the air are triggering another problem for Delhi. Pollution levels have remained consistently high. The Air Quality Index of Delhi was 311, which means that Delhiites are still inhaling very poor quality air. \n",
      "“While high moisture content increases that air’s capacity to hold o to pollutants the low wind speed is failing to disperse the pollutants that are trapped in the city’s air. We would need some strong dry winds from the north west to flush out the pollutants,” said D Saha, head of the air quality laboratory at Central Pollution Control Board. \n",
      "The presence of dust and pollutants also help in the formation of fog. Water vapour condenses around these microscopic solid particles triggering fog.\n",
      "SAFAR which is maintained by the union ministry of earth sciences, has forecast that levels of PM2.5 and PM10 – the primary pollutants of Delhi’s air - could rise in the next three days.\n",

      "To improve the services at the airport, the officials discussed improving technology, providing modern equipment, additional space and professional manpower. Senior officials of the home ministry, Bureau of Immigration and Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), which operates the IGI Airport, participated in the meeting.  \n",
      "“The Bureau of Immigration (BOI) will provide an additional 1,800 personnel for improving immigration services by filling up vacant posts, inducting personnel from the Central Armed Police Forces and also some ex-servicemen,” the home ministry said in a statement released on Thursday.\n",
      "“The Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) will provide space for at least 10 immigration counters at the departure area by November 15, while additional space will be provided for another 10 immigration counters to be made functional by January 2018,” an MHA official said.\n",
      "At least 10 e-visa counters would be made functional for electronic visa facility for foreigners by November 30. Twenty-five more counters for electronic visa facility will be made functional by January 2018, the statement said. Electronic visa is granted to citizens of over 160 countries.\n",
